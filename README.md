Data Structures Technical Interviewing Workshop

# Introduction

- Thank everyone for attending the Data Structures Technical Interviewing workshop.
- Remind everyone to go on mute.
- Once it is time to start, start. If there are more people supposed to jump on give it an extra minute or two but try your best to start at the exact time listed on the Career Services registration page.
- Make sure to make an announcement about attendance. Have the second CD on the call put it in the chat. The second CD should be monitoring who logs in and making sure that they are marking students attendance as well.
- Open the [powerpoint](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1o6lIiKLCqXbgf5KELf4QL-YreRrMnU4EyeElqNXsv2A/edit?usp=sharing) and introduce yourself. Have the second CD slack out the powerpoint so that students can follow along with you.

# Topics

- The topics slide goes over the topics that we are going to cover durring the session.

# Get The Most Out Of This Session

- Set some ground rules for the session. If students have any questions make sure that the second CD is answering them in the chat.

# Types of Technical Tests

- Go through the types of Technical Tests that students might get while they are going through a Technical Interview.
- Make sure that you emphasize that for the sake of this webinar we will be focusing on Whiteboarding because they correlate to Data Structure type questions. If they are interested in learning more about the different types of Technical Exams, you can sign up for our Employer Competative Workshops on the Career Services Online Workshop Website, or through BCS.

# TEBOW IT

- This is a popular strategy that developers in the industry use to write effective code.
- Make sure that you go through the slide in the TEBOW order. That is Talk, Examples, Brute Force, Optimize, Walk Through.
- Remind students that if they have time to do the IT portion of the TEBOW IT method then they.
- Because you are whiteboarding you might not have to IT, but for the sake of the coding section make sure that when you review the example in the console you are doing IT.

# What is Recursion

- Make sure that you explain that this is a concept.
- Define Recursion.

# For Example

- Work through the example, emphasize that the red is recurssion and the yellow is the base case.

# What is the Fibonacci Sequence

- Make sure that you showcase the Fibonacci sequence.
- Explain the math behind it.
- Call on a student to make sure that there is understanding as to what fibonacci sequence is.

# Fibonnaci Sequence as Mathamatical Rule

- Explain how we can make this concept into a rule.
- Do not explain Fibonacci Sequence as f(n) make sure they know that its Fibonacci of n because they might think that f(n) is an algorithm concept but we want them to realize that people use f because it stands for fibonacci. Also, you can replace f with x to show that it does not matter what f stands for.

# Why is this recurssive

- Make sure that you bring back the computer example so that they can tie in the dots.

# Lets Code

- Have the Second CD on the call put the unsolvedrecursion.js file in the chat.
- Make sure that you emphasize that Psuedo Coding is important and that it is crucial that they psuedo code before they complete this task. If they do not psuedo code then the Technical Interviewer can take it against them.
- Psuedo Coding is a great way for them to showcase their thought process. If they are able to explain what the Fibonacci Sequence / Recursion is doing and write minimal code then it will still be a strong answer.
- Tell students they have 10 minutes to solve this problem.
- After 10 minutes has passed, ask students to share their psuedo code.
- If people do not want to share call on them.
- Once people explain their Psuedo Code then have people share their code.
- Put their code into the console and see if it works practice IT.
- Open the solution, and have someone explain the solution and what is happening.
- Put the solution into the console and run the function.
- Make sure that you test it off of the F(n), n chart in the powerpoint
